Intelligence-Inference-Engine
=============================

A web application providing a repository for storing and searching OSINT data as well as internal cyberattack data using semantic web techniques. 

The backing store should be one of the existing semantic web triple- or quad-stores such as Mulgara or Jena and should be queryable directly using 
Sparql or Datalog. 

The structure and interface should provide for storing intelligence-critical metadata such as assertion provenance and confidence of assertions.

This project is built on Bootstrap + Jquery for front-end and Mulgara as a back-end triple store.

A development version of this is available at http://iie-dev.cs.fiu.edu/
