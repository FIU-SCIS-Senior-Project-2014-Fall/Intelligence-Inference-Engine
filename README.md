Intelligence-Inference-Engine
=============================

A web application providing a repository for storing and searching OSINT data as well as internal cyberattack data using semantic web techniques. 
The backing store should be one of the existing semantic web triple- or quad-stores such as Mulgara or Jena and should be queryable directly using 
Sparql or Datalog. The structure and interface should provide for storing intelligence-critical metadata such as assertion provenance and confidence of assertions.
